2. When the button is clicked, a modal dialog opens.
3. The modal dialog contains a single field labelled "Enter a City".
4. That field uses the jquery-ui autocomplete plugin to look up cities, just as in the demo located here: http://jqueryui.com/autocomplete/#remote-jsonp. 
5. The application does not need a backend.
6. The applicaiton does not need to save any data.
